A set of tools for testing your REST calls based on the OpenApi specification using PHPUnit.
Currently, this library supports the OpenApi specifications `2.0` (formerly swagger) and `3.0`.
Some features like callbacks, links and references to external documents/objects weren't implemented.

PHP Swagger Test can help you to test your REST Api. You can use this tool both for Unit Tests or Functional Tests.

This tool reads a previously Swagger JSON file (not YAML) and enables you to test the request and response.
You can use the tool "[https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php)" for creating the JSON file when you are developing your
rest API.

The ApiTestCase's assertion process is based on throwing exceptions if some validation or test failed.

## Use cases for PHP Swagger test

- [Functional test cases](docs/functional-tests.md)
